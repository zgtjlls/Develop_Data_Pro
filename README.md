## User Manual
### Introduction
This Shiny web application can be used to run models with selected data from a plot.

### Inputs
Select a model from the drop down menus on the left.
Select data from the plot

### Precedure
After selecting the model and data, simply pressing the 'Go' button to run the model.

### Outputs
Model summary will be output in the bottom right panel.

### Application
This app is handy for doing preliminary model selection/comparing and outlier identification analysis as it provides immediate model estimation with the flexibility of subseting any portion of the data.

### Further work
Right now, as an example, only the mtcar data is loaded. This can be further improved by giving user the option to load any data it needed.

Moreover, only the simple linear model and the no-intercept model are predefined. This can be improved by allowing the user to define it's own models.
